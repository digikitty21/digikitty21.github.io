        <h2>Stuff I've Drawn</h2>
		    <!--Add your (good)art-->
		    <p>Note: My most recent art is at the top. As you scroll down, the quality <strong>will</strong> worsen.<br />
          Also, most of these have been scaled down from their original size to fit this website. If you wish to see the originals, just send me an email about it.</p>
        <img src="emo.png" alt="emo. the file is literally called emo"><br />
        <p>I drew this for a presentation for English class. I know the blue everything probably looks weird, but realistic colors look awful with the background and I feel the blue really works with it.</p>
        <img src="three%20feet%20high.png" alt="I was bored"><br />
        <p>I haven't really been liking my art style lately, so I completely overhauled it. I'm still not too happy, but I'm happier than I was</p>
  		  <img src="spoopy%20cyn%20y%20nino.png" alt="these two are some of my favorite chil- i meaaaan uhhhhh ocs"><br />
		    <p>These two are uhhhh... from the same universe. You'll see Cyn in later drawings, but this is my first digital drawing of Nino, that girl in the background. I'm hopefully going to write their story soon, but uhm.... I am way too good at procrastination.</p>
		    <img src="plz%20let%20go.png" alt="My old lock screen"><br />
	  	  <p>This was my lock screen, I like it but the angle is kinda awkward and it was just meant to be a placeholder anyway</p>
		    <!--<img src="the%20whole%20fam(kinda).png" alt="All of my OCs that I actually draw"/><br />
        <p>I hate this drawing, but what can ya do?</p>-->
        <h5>Removed and re-moved to the "BURN IT" folder on my laptop</h5>
  		  <img src="cyn.png" alt="Cyn. Just Cyn"/><br />
	  	  <p>This is Cyn, he is my precious Cynnamon roll. His full name is actually really weird, it's Cyneweard. Yes, he is wearing cat slippers. They look really out of place, sometimes, but whatever.</p>
		    <img src="Mothers%20Day!.png" alt="Something I drew for my mom for Valentine's Day"/><br />
        <p>I drew this for Mother's Day, I don't really like it but I forced by mom to use it as her home screen for at least a day.</p>
  		  <img src="MY%20CHILDREN.png" alt="My old home screen"/><br />
	  	  <p>This was my home screen. It's cool and I used it for over half a year, but I just had to change my home screen eventually</p>
		    <img src="Stahp.png" alt="Shadow Cat biting a stop sign"/><br />
		    <p>This used to be my lock screen, I'm planning on redrawing it since there's a bunch of errors</p>
		    <img src="Oculus%20and%20Shadow%20Cat.png" alt="Just Oculus and Shadow Cat being themselves, I guess"/><br />
        <p>The green cat-thing, Oculus, looks different in this than in other drawing because this was the first time I drew him and I hadn't really figured out how I wanted him to look yet.<br />Fun Fact: He's bright green because I asked my dad for three numbers between one and 255, he gave me one, one hundred, and 255, so the RGB values for Oculus are 1, 255, 100</p>
	  	  <img src="Pride.png" alt="A picture I drew to show how gay I am"/><br />
		    <p>Still one of my favorite drawings</p>
		    <img src="Who%3F.png" alt="An owl"/><br />
		    <p>I drew this for school but it actually looks nice so I show it to people</p>
		    <img src="Shadow%20Cat%20says%20Hi.png" alt="Old art of Shadow Cat(with a different design than he currently has) waving" />
  		  <p>LOOK AT MY SON! PRIDE IS NOT THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR, THERE IS SO MUCH MORE IN ME NOW!(This is from a Hamilton song)</p>

          <h4>Mar 25, around 1 am</h4>
          <p>Finally got around to messing with HTML again. I don't have any log of updates before this one, so I'll just start here.</p>

          </ol>

          <h4>Apr 12, 2:30-ish</h4>
          <p>I went through the art on my laptop and moved a lot of stuff into "BURN IT"; luckily, only one of the ones I moved was on here too.</p>
          <ol>
            <li style="float:none">Removed "the whole fam(kinda).png", otherwise known as "All of my OCs that I actually draw".</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Today's a sick day so I figured I should update the quotes.</p>

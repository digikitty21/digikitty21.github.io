		  <p>"If you know yourself and the enemy, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.<br />

			  If you know neither yourself nor the enemy, you shall succumb in every battle.<br />
			  If you know the enemy and not yourself, you're an American."

		  <!--Add your (good)art-->
		  <p>Note: My most recent art is at the top. As you scroll down, the quality <strong>will</strong> worsen</p>
		  <img src="spoopy%20cyn%20y%20nino.png" alt="these two are some of my favorite chil- i meaaaan uhhhhh ocs"><br />
		  <p>These two are uhhhh... from the same universe. You'll see Cyn in later drawings, but this is my first digital drawing of Nino, that girl in the background. I'm hopefully going to write their story soon, but uhm.... I am way too good at procrastination.</p>
		  <img src="plz%20let%20go.png" alt="My lock screen"><br />
		  <p>This is currently my lock screen</p>
		  <img src="the%20whole%20fam(kinda).png" alt="All of my OCs that I actually draw"/><br />
		  <img src="cyn.png" alt="Cyn. Just Cyn"/><br />
		  <p>This is Cyn, he is my precious Cynnamon roll. His full name is actually really weird, it's Cyneweard. Yes, he is wearing cat slippers. They look really out of place, sometimes, but whatever.</p>
		  <img src="Mothers%20Day!.png" alt="Something I drew for my mom for Valentine's Day"/><br />
		  <img src="MY%20CHILDREN.png" alt="My home screen"/><br />
		  <p>This is my home screen</p>
		  <img src="Stahp.png" alt="Shadow Cat biting a stop sign"/><br />
		  <p>This used to be my lock screen, I'm planning on redrawing it since there's a bunch of errors</p>
		  <img src="Oculus%20and%20Shadow%20Cat.png" alt="Just Oculus and Shadow Cat being themselves, I guess"/><br />
		  <img src="Pride.png" alt="A picture I drew to show how gay I am"/><br />
		  <p>Still one of my favorite drawings</p>
		  <img src="Who%3F.png" alt="An owl"/><br />
		  <p>I drew this for school but it actually looks nice so I show it to people</p>

		  <h2><a name="Hands"></a>Hands I've Drawn(yes I'm being serious)</h2>
		  <!--Add any and all hands-->
		  <p>Since I am aware that many artists-- especially me-- struggle to draw hands, I've decided to make a whole section dedicated to every hand that I have ever drawn(digitally). You may notice that you don't recognize where many of these hands come from; that's because some of them are from unfinished/abandoned drawings. Also, there's art that I've deemed too awful to show people, I keep those drawings in a folder called "BURN IT" which has six pieces of artwork that are just... so... bad...</p>
		  <img src="Hand%20-%20Caffeine%201.png"alt="Original is in "BURN IT""><br />

		  <img src="Hand%20-%20Cyn%202.png"alt="Same as above"><br />
		  <img src="Hand%20-%20Drawception%201.png"alt="Original is a thing I drew using an art program that really isn't meant for drawing really great, it doesn't even have layers which is why the colors here are going outside the lines"><br />
		  <img src="Hand%20-%20Drawception%202.png"alt="Same as above"><br />
		  <img src="Hand%20-%20el%20restaurante%201.png"alt="Original is from a scene that happened during a skit I was a part of in Spansish class"><br />
		  <img src="Hand%20-%20handz%20suck%201.png"alt="Original is a really crappy thing I drew for History class, the issue being that THIS was the main focus of the picture"><br />
		  <img src="Hand%20-%20It's%20my%20Burr-day%201.png"alt="Original is a thing I was trying to draw for Alexander Hamilton's birthday, but I abandoned it because of how awful it was"><br />
